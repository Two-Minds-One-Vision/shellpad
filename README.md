## Core Problems

- **Overwhelming input**  
  Too much information shared too quickly to capture and organize effectively.

- **Messy, incomplete notes**  
  Notes often end up fragmented, hard to review, or require rewriting later.

- **Scattered knowledge**  
  Notes and insights are stored in multiple places and are hard to retrieve later.

- **Limited time & focus**  
  Users don’t have the bandwidth to take clean, structured notes at the moment.

- **Recall challenges**  
  Hard to revisit or build on what was learned over time.
